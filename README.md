# SAR-Colorization-v2
This repository provides a brief guideline of using SAR image colorization network, including preparing dataset, training and test model, and reconstruction.
- More detail information about the network as well as how it works [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8141881)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/install.html)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
